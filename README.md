### What is it ?
Chronicle Logger is an extremely fast java logger. We feel logging should not slow down your system.

Chronicle logger is able to aggregate all your logs to a central store. It has built in resilience, so you will never loose messages.

Chronicle logger supports most of the standard logging APIâ€™s including slf4j, sun logging, commons logging, log4j.

Today most programs require the logging of large amounts of data, especially in trading systems where this is a regulatory requirement. Loggers can affect your system performance, therefore logging is sometimes kept to a minimum, With chronicle we aim to eliminate this added overhead, freeing your system to focus on the business logic.

# How it works

Chronicle logger is built on Chronicle Queue. It provides multiple Chronicle Queue adapters and is a low latency, high throughput synchronous writer. Unlike asynchronous writers, you will always see the last message before the application dies.  As the last message is often the most valuable.
