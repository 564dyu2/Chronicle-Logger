### Overview
Today most programs require the logging of large amounts of data, especially in trading systems where this is a regulatory requirement. Loggers can affect your system performance, therefore logging is sometimes kept to a minimum, With chronicle we aim to eliminate this added overhead, freeing your system to focus on the business logic.

Chronicle logger supports most of the standard logging APIâ€™s including: 
  * [slf4j](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger#slf4j)
  * [logback](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger#logback)
  * [Apache log4j 1.2](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger#log4j-1)
  * [Apache log4j 2](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger#log4j-2)
  * [Java Util Logging](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger#jul)
  * [Apache Common Logging](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger#jcl)

Chronicle logger is able to aggregate all your logs to a central store. It has built in resilience, so you will never loose messages.

We also have some very helpfull [tools] (https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Logger/wiki/logger-tools)

### How it works
Chronicle logger is built on Chronicle Queue. It provides multiple Chronicle Queue adapters and is a low latency, high throughput synchronous writer. Unlike asynchronous writers, you will always see the last message before the application dies.  As the last message is often the most valuable.
